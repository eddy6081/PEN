# PEN
The Projection-Enhancement Network

Chris edit this mark down. We want to include the basic figure where PEN is built on top of a CNN, Figure 1, and some of the segmentation results (Figure 3). Also include some of the cell-fluorescence images as a max projection and as a gif so people can understand our data.
